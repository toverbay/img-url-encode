# Image URL Encoding Tool

I read an article on [dev.to](https://dev.to) about [generating image data URLs](https://dev.to/dcodeyt/how-to-convert-images-to-base64-data-urls-in-javascript-2n3i) and I thought I'd throw together this website to practice my vanilla html/css/javascript skills and to provide a useful tool.
